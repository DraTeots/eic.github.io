### The Goal
This website is been deveoped with the goal to support the software domain of the EIC community.

### The Platform
The following considerations are important for long-term viability of the site:
* ease of maintenance
* security
* performance
* portability

In order to meet these criteria this website relies on modern static
website generator technology with the following features:
* separation of content (including text as well as numeric data and graphics) from the layout of individual pages as well as of the website as whole
* management of potentially complex structured data without reliance on databases, by keeping data in JSON, YAML and CSV formats
* use of a highly readable and an easy-to-edit syntax for content creation (the so-called *Markdown* syntax)

To this end, the popular <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website generator is used, with
additional tools (Javascript libraries and advanced stylesheets) for optimal user experience.
